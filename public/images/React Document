 How React Work?
-  React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.

React Render HTML
- using function ReactDOM.render()
- The ReactDOM.render() function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.
- ReactDOM.render(<p>Hello</p>, document.getElementById('root'));

-The HTML code in this tutorial uses JSX which allows you to write HTML tags inside the JavaScript code:
const myelement = (
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>John</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Elsa</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
);

ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));

React JSX
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
- JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
- JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

React Components

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.

Create a Class Component:

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

Create a Function Component:

function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am also a Car!</h2>;
}

React Props

- Props are arguments passed into React components.
- Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

const myelement = <Car brand="Ford" />;


React State

- The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
- When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
- The state object is initialized in the constructor.
- To change a value in the state object, use the this.setState() method.
